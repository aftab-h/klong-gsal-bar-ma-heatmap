HOW TO USE:

1) Open heatmap.html in browser.

2) You can click on any yellow-highlighted text in the right pane, which is the LS Corpus pane. It is mostly dummy text for now for proof of concept. When clicking on highlighted text, it will scroll left pane (T Text) to the matching quote found in T Text.

3) You can click on any green-highlighted text in the T text pane on the left, and it will (in console) log what Volume and Text No. that this clicked line appears in LS Corpus. This will be expanded to appear in a context menu, where you can click on the entries and it will scroll right pane to exactly where in LS Corpus the citation appears.
